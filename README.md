# data-cleaning-steps
Success data cleaning in three steps
In this module we are going talk about data mining of exploratory data analysis (EDA) method and data processing also known as data preprocessing (DP) and finally data visualization (DataViz).
## I. EDA method
  ### I.1. loading data
  ### I.2 data description
  ### I.3. exploratory data analysis:
    a) univariate
    b) bivariate
    c) multivariate
## II. Statistical relations
## III. Problem detection
  ### III.1. missing value
  ### III.2. duplicates value
  ### III.3. outlier value
## IV. Data preprocessing method
These methods consist of setting the problems we found in data mining and do some necessary transformations like transform categorical variables in digital and normalize the data.
## V. Visualization method
Here we will see several graphs with the packages of Python:
  ### V.1. Matplotlib,
  ### V.2. Seaborn,
  ### V.3. Plotly Express.
